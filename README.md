Open Vetta brings models, project files, local tools, and reusable capabilities into one desktop workspace. Use it for coding, documents, data, research, creative work, and repeatable workflows without giving up control of the environment where the work happens.

It is more than a chat interface: Vetta can inspect a workspace, use tools with visible permission boundaries, produce real files, and keep the execution trail available for review.

## Why Open Vetta

| | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Local-first workspace** | Projects, sessions, files, and execution live in the environment you choose. |
| **Bring your own models** | Connect supported providers, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, or local inference through BYOK. |
| **Real tools and artifacts** | Work with code, documents, spreadsheets, media, commands, and generated files in one task flow. |
| **Reviewable execution** | Tool calls, plans, permissions, progress, results, and recovery paths remain visible. |
| **Reusable workflows** | Extend the agent with skills, MCP servers, plugins, themes, knowledge, batch tasks, and automation. |
| **Open client stack** | The desktop app, CLI, SDK, plugin system, themes, mobile client, and IM gateway are developed in this repository. |

## Start here

| I want to… | Start with |
|---|---|
| Use the desktop app | [Download for macOS, Windows, or Linux](https://www.openvetta.com/download), then follow [installation and first setup](https://docs.openvetta.com/getting-started/). |
| Complete a real task | Follow the [first-task walkthrough](https://docs.openvetta.com/getting-started/first-task/). |
| Understand the product | Read the [product guide](https://docs.openvetta.com/product/overview/) and [security and data boundaries](https://docs.openvetta.com/reference/security-and-data/). |
| Build an extension | Choose between [skills, MCP, plugins, themes, SDK, RPC, and CLI](https://docs.openvetta.com/developers/overview/). |
| Contribute code | Read [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). |

### Run from source

Requires **Bun 1.3+** and **Node.js 20+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openvetta/open-vetta.git
cd open-vetta
git switch dev
bun install
cd apps/desktop
bun run dev
```

The development app uses `~/.vetta-dev` by default, keeping installed-app data in `~/.vetta` untouched. Root-level `bun run dev` watches core libraries; it does not launch Electron. See [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) for the complete setup and validation commands.

## What you can do

- **Work in projects and sessions.** Keep task history, files, context, artifacts, and execution details together.
- **Use local and external tools.** Run commands, inspect files, connect MCP services, and approve sensitive operations explicitly.
- **Handle professional artifacts.** Preview and work with source code, PDF, Office files, spreadsheets, images, audio, video, SVG, and generated UI.
- **Scale a proven task.** Run the same workflow across directories with batch tasks, or schedule it as an automation.
- **Reuse organizational knowledge.** Build local knowledge bases and install reusable skills or scenarios.
- **Keep working away from the desk.** Use supported IM bridges, webhooks, notifications, quick entry, and native desktop integrations.

The public documentation has the current task guides and screenshots: [browse all product capabilities](https://docs.openvetta.com/product/overview/).

## Extension model

Vetta exposes several extension levels so a simple workflow does not need to become a full plugin:

| Extension | Use it for | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill** | Teach the agent a repeatable method or domain workflow. | [Abilities](https://docs.openvetta.com/product/abilities/) |
| **MCP** | Connect external tools and data over a standard protocol. | [MCP connectors](https://docs.openvetta.com/product/mcp/) |
| **Plugin** | Extend the desktop UI, files, messages, tools, and host actions. | [Plugin development](https://docs.openvetta.com/plugins/overview/) |
| **Theme** | Replace the visual system and provide theme-specific pages. | [Theme development](https://docs.openvetta.com/themes/overview/) |
| **SDK / RPC / CLI** | Embed or drive the agent from another application or process. | [Developer paths](https://docs.openvetta.com/developers/overview/) |

### Build a plugin from any directory

You do not need this repository, or a Vetta source checkout, to build a plugin. Nor does an agent:

```bash
npx @vetta-org/plugin-cli init --id my-plugin --name "My Plugin"
cd my-plugin && npm install
npx vetta-plugin-cli docs        # where the manual is, and which SDK version it documents
npm run install:vetta            # build, package, install into the running desktop app
npx vetta-plugin-cli watch       # hot reload: the host loads the plugin from this directory
```

`init` also writes an `AGENTS.md`, so **any** coding agent — Claude Code, Cursor, or Vetta's own —
picks the project up without host-side setup. The plugin manual ships inside
`@vetta-org/plugin-sdk`, so the contract an agent reads is the contract the project compiles
against; `docs` locates it rather than anyone hard-coding a `node_modules` path.

To publish several abilities from one repository, scaffold a marketplace:

```bash
npx @vetta-org/plugin-cli init hub --name my-market \
  --repository https://github.com/me/my-market --min-app-version 0.55.0
```

That lays down the index, the `abilities/` layout, a repository-level `AGENTS.md`, and CI running
`vetta-plugin-cli sync --check`, which keeps `.vetta/marketplace.json` reconciled with each ability
package. Development commands always act on the nearest ability directory, so working inside a
marketplace is identical to working on a standalone plugin.

Plugins declare capabilities in `plugin.json`; privileged operations are authorized by the host and checked again at runtime. Plugins run inside the desktop renderer and should be treated as curated code, not as an arbitrary-code sandbox. Read the [plugin trust and permission model](https://docs.openvetta.com/plugins/manifest-and-permissions/) before distributing one.

## Data and build modes

A source checkout produces the **lite** build by default. It has no dependency on a Vetta-operated backend: no account, subscription, remote administration, or hosted marketplace is required. Model requests go to the endpoint you configure, and credentials remain in local credential storage.

Official installers may enable the optional Vetta Serv integration for accounts, subscriptions, and a hosted marketplace. That integration is selected at build time; it is not silently enabled in a lite build.

Local-first does not mean zero network traffic. Model providers, MCP servers, plugins, webhooks, IM integrations, update sources, and optional telemetry can each create their own data boundary. Review:

- [Security and data boundaries](https://docs.openvetta.com/reference/security-and-data/)
- [Configuration paths](https://docs.openvetta.com/reference/configuration-paths/)
- [Build modes and environment variables](docs/desktop/build-modes.en.md)
- [Security policy](SECURITY.md)

## Repository map

This is a Bun/TypeScript monorepo with additional Swift, Kotlin and Go applications. Dependencies point from applications toward reusable packages; `packages/*` never depend on `apps/*`.

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`apps/desktop`](apps/desktop) | Electron desktop host and renderer |
| [`apps/cli-host`](apps/cli-host) | CLI host for the coding agent |
| [`apps/docs-site`](apps/docs-site) | Next.js documentation site published at `docs.openvetta.com` |
| [`apps/mobile/client-apple`](apps/mobile/client-apple) | Native iOS client in Swift/SwiftUI (pairs with the desktop over LAN or relay, end-to-end encrypted) |
| [`apps/mobile/client-android`](apps/mobile/client-android) | Kotlin Multiplatform Android client (frozen at protocol v1, kept for reference) |
| [`apps/im-gateway`](apps/im-gateway) | Go IM sidecar gateway |
| [`packages/ai`](packages/ai) · [`packages/agent`](packages/agent) | Provider abstraction and the agent loop |
| [`packages/coding-agent`](packages/coding-agent) · `packages/runtime-*` | Product composition, runtime contracts, tools, storage, MCP, and host adapters |
| [`packages/plugins`](packages/plugins) · [`packages/themes`](packages/themes) | Extension SDKs, presets, and themes |

Architecture details and public integration contracts live in the [developer documentation](https://docs.openvetta.com/developers/architecture/) and [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Develop and contribute

Use Bun and the repository scripts; do not run bare `bun test` in this monorepo.

```bash
bun run check:quick              # changed-file lint and architecture guards
bun run check                    # full lint, types, and architecture guards
bun run test:pkg <package-name>  # focused package tests
bun run test:changed             # tests affected by the current diff
```
